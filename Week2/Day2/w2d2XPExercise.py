# Exercise 1 : Pets
# Instructions
# Using this code:

# class Pets():
#     def __init__(self, animals):
#         self.animals = animals

#     def walk(self):
#         for animal in self.animals:
#             print(animal.walk())

# class Cat():
#     is_lazy = True

#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age

#     def walk(self):
#         return f'{self.name} is just walking around'

# class Bengal(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'

# class Chartreux(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'


# Create another cat breed named Siamese which inherits from the Cat class.
# Create a list called all_cats, which holds three cat instances : one Bengal, one Chartreux and one Siamese.
# Those three cats are Sara‚Äôs pets. Create a variable called sara_pets which value is an instance of the Pet class, and pass the variable all_cats to the new instance.
# Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method.


# üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog with the following attributes name, age, weight.
# Implement the following methods in the Dog class:
# bark: returns a string which states: ‚Äú<dog_name> is barking‚Äù.
# run_speed: returns the dogs running speed (weight/age*10).
# fight : takes a parameter which value is another Dog instance, called other_dog. This method returns a string stating which dog won the fight. The winner should be the dog with the higher run_speed x weight.

# Create 3 dogs and run them through your class.


# üåü Exercise 3 : Dogs Domesticated
# Instructions
# Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
# In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
# Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.
# Add the following methods:
# train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True

# play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other Dog instances (use *args). The method should print the following string: ‚Äúdog_names all play together‚Äù.

# do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
# ‚Äúdog_name does a barrel roll‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name stands on his back legs‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name shakes your hand‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name plays dead‚Äù.


# Exercise 4 : Family
# Instructions
# Create a class called Family and implement the following attributes:

# members: list of dictionaries
# last_name : (string)

# Implement the following methods:

# born: adds a child to the members list (use **kwargs), don‚Äôt forget to print a message congratulating the family.
# is_18: takes the name of a family member as a parameter and returns True if they are over 18 and False if not.
# family_presentation: a method that prints the family‚Äôs last name and all the members‚Äô details.

# Create an instance of the Family class, with the last name of your choice, and the below members. Then call all the methods you created in Point 2.

#     [
#         {'name':'Michael','age':35,'gender':'Male','is_child':False},
#         {'name':'Sarah','age':32,'gender':'Female','is_child':False}
#     ]


# Exercise 5 : TheIncredibles Family
# Instructions
# Create a class called TheIncredibles. This class should inherit from the Family class:
# This is no random family they are an incredible family, therefore the members attributes, will be a list of dictionaries containing the additional keys : power and incredible_name. (See Point 4)


# Add a method called use_power, this method should print the power of a member only if they are over 18 years old. If not raise an exception (look up exceptions) which stated they are not over 18 years old.


# Add a method called incredible_presentation which :

# Print a sentence like ‚Äú*Here is our powerful family **‚Äù
# Prints the family‚Äôs last name and all the members‚Äô details (ie. use the super() function, to call the family_presentation method)


# Create an instance of the Incredibles class, with the ‚ÄúIncredibles‚Äù last name, and the below members.

#     [
#         {'name':'Michael','age':35,'gender':'Male','is_child':False,'power': 'fly','incredible_name':'MikeFly'},
#         {'name':'Sarah','age':32,'gender':'Female','is_child':False,'power': 'read minds','incredible_name':'SuperWoman'}
#     ]


# Call the incredible_presentation method.


# Use the born method inherited from the Family class to add Baby Jack with the following power: ‚ÄúUnknown Power‚Äù.


# Call the incredible_presentation method again.
