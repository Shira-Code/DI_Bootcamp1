-- What You will learn :
-- Table relationships
-- Different type of JOINS


-- Instructions
-- You are going to practice tables relationships

-- Part I
-- Create 2 tables : Customer and Customer profile. They have a One to One relationship.
-- A customer can have only one profile, and a profile belongs to only one customer
-- The Customer table should have the columns : id, first_name, last_name NOT NULL
-- The Customer profile table should have the columns : id, isLoggedIn DEFAULT false (a Boolean), customer_id (a reference to the Customer table)

CREATE TABLE Customer (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- Insert those customers

-- John, Doe
-- Jerome, Lalu
-- Lea, Rive
INSERT INTO Customer (first_name, last_name) VALUES
('John', 'Doe'),
('Jerome', 'Lalu'),
('Lea', 'Rive');

-- Insert those customer profiles, use subqueries

-- John is loggedIn
-- Jerome is not logged in

INSERT INTO CustomerProfile (isLoggedIn, customer_id)
SELECT TRUE, id FROM Customer WHERE first_name = 'John';

INSERT INTO CustomerProfile (isLoggedIn, customer_id)
SELECT FALSE, id FROM Customer WHERE first_name = 'Jerome';

-- Use the relevant types of Joins to display:

-- The first_name of the LoggedIn customers

SELECT c.first_name
FROM Customer c
JOIN CustomerProfile cp ON c.id = cp.customer_id
WHERE cp.isLoggedIn = TRUE;
-- All the customers first_name and isLoggedIn columns - even the customers those who donâ€™t have a profile.

SELECT c.first_name, COALESCE(cp.isLoggedIn, FALSE) AS isLoggedIn
FROM Customer c
LEFT JOIN CustomerProfile cp ON c.id = cp.customer_id;
-- The number of customers that are not LoggedIn

SELECT COUNT(*) AS not_logged_in_count
FROM Customer c
LEFT JOIN CustomerProfile cp ON c.id = cp.customer_id
WHERE cp.isLoggedIn IS DISTINCT FROM TRUE;


Part II:

-- Create a table named Book, with the columns : book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, title NOT NULL, author NOT NULL

CREATE TABLE Book (
    book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- Insert those books :
-- Alice In Wonderland, Lewis Carroll
-- Harry Potter, J.K Rowling
-- To kill a mockingbird, Harper Lee

INSERT INTO Book (title, author) VALUES
('Alice In Wonderland', 'Lewis Carroll'),
('Harry Potter', 'J.K. Rowling'),
('To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Harper Lee');

-- Create a table named Student, with the columns : student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name NOT NULL UNIQUE, age. Make sure that the age is never bigger than 15 (Find an SQL method);

CREATE TABLE Student (
    student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    age INT CHECK (age <= 15)
);

-- Insert those students:
-- John, 12
-- Lera, 11
-- Patrick, 10
-- Bob, 14

INSERT INTO Student (name, age) VALUES
('John', 12),
('Lera', 11),
('Patrick', 10),
('Bob', 14);

-- Create a table named Library, with the columns :
-- book_fk_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
-- student_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
-- borrowed_date
-- This table, is a junction table for a Many to Many relationship with the Book and Student tables : A student can borrow many books, and a book can be borrowed by many children
-- book_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column book_id from the Book table
-- student_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column student_id from the Student table
-- The pair of Foreign Keys is the Primary Key of the Junction Table

CREATE TABLE Library (
    book_fk_id INT,
    student_fk_id INT,
    borrowed_date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (book_fk_id, student_fk_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_fk_id) REFERENCES Book(book_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_fk_id) REFERENCES Student(student_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

-- Add 4 records in the junction table, use subqueries.
-- the student named John, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 15/02/2022
-- the student named Bob, borrowed the book To kill a mockingbird on the 03/03/2021
-- the student named Lera, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 23/05/2021
-- the student named Bob, borrowed the book Harry Potter the on 12/08/2021

INSERT INTO Library (book_fk_id, student_fk_id, borrowed_date)
SELECT book_id, student_id, '2022-02-15'
FROM Book, Student
WHERE title = 'Alice In Wonderland' AND name = 'John';

INSERT INTO Library (book_fk_id, student_fk_id, borrowed_date)
SELECT book_id, student_id, '2021-03-03'
FROM Book, Student
WHERE title = 'To Kill a Mockingbird' AND name = 'Bob';

INSERT INTO Library (book_fk_id, student_fk_id, borrowed_date)
SELECT book_id, student_id, '2021-05-23'
FROM Book, Student
WHERE title = 'Alice In Wonderland' AND name = 'Lera';

INSERT INTO Library (book_fk_id, student_fk_id, borrowed_date)
SELECT book_id, student_id, '2021-08-12'
FROM Book, Student
WHERE title = 'Harry Potter' AND name = 'Bob';

-- Display the data
-- Select all the columns from the junction table
SELECT * FROM Library;

-- Select the name of the student and the title of the borrowed books
SELECT s.name, b.title
FROM Library l
JOIN Student s ON l.student_fk_id = s.student_id
JOIN Book b ON l.book_fk_id = b.book_id;

-- Select the average age of the children, that borrowed the book Alice in Wonderland

SELECT AVG(s.age) AS average_age
FROM Library l
JOIN Student s ON l.student_fk_id = s.student_id
JOIN Book b ON l.book_fk_id = b.book_id
WHERE b.title = 'Alice In Wonderland';
-- Delete a student from the Student table, what happened in the junction table ?

DELETE FROM Student WHERE name = 'Patrick';

-- ## rows in the Library table where student_fk_id is the student_id of 'Patrick'  was also deleted.
