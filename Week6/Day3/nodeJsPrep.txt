omorrow is a mini-project day, and it is also open for reviewing topics you need help with before starting Node.js on Wednesday.
Some of the topics to review before Node.js :
Functions: Callback functions, Anonymous functions, Arrow functions, Default parameters
Asynchronous: Promises, Async/Await
Fetch: GET / POST
Forms: GET / POST
Strings: Template literals
Ternary operator: Short conditions
Array methods: map, filter, find, reduce, findIndex, slice, splice, forEach
Object & Array Destructuring, Function Destructuring, Spread Operator, Rest parameters, Cloning, Shorthand properties, Dynamic keys
Classes: constructor, this, extends, methods


Let’s try to refocus and bring back a positive mindset.
We're all here to learn and grow together, and the most interesting and complex topics are still ahead of us, 
like Node.js, React, Redux, and TypeScript.
Also, I encourage you to come onsite. It’s your decision to take advantage of this
 opportunity because it will be a much better experience for you.
Working together in person can help us all bond and stay motivated.
Let’s push through, support each other, and make the most out of these 
next exciting weeks!
