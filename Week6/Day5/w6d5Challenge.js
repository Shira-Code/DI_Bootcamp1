// Last Updated: October 16th, 2023

// What you will learn:
// Use Express to build an API
// Use Node.js modules


// Instructions
// Create a fun emoji guessing game using an Express API.
// The game will present players with a random emoji and a set of options. Players 
// need to guess the correct name of the emoji from the given options.
// The game will keep track of the player‚Äôs score and provide feedback on their guesses.

// Requirements:

// Set up an Express server to handle the game.

// Create an array of emoji objects, each containing the emoji character and its corresponding name.

// Generate a random emoji from the array and select a few incorrect options as distractors.

// Using a form, present the player with the random emoji and multiple choice options (including the correct name).

// Allow the player to submit their guess. Get the data from the form and POST it, using the Fetch API.

// Check if the guess is correct and update the player‚Äôs score.

// Provide feedback to the player, indicating whether their guess was correct or not.

// Continue presenting new emojis and options for the player to guess.

// Keep track of the player‚Äôs total score.

// Implement a leaderboard to show the top scores.
// sample emojis

// const emojis = [
//     { emoji: 'üòÄ', name: 'Smile' },
//     { emoji: 'üê∂', name: 'Dog' },
//     { emoji: 'üåÆ', name: 'Taco' },
//     // Add more emoji objects
// ];
// Advanced Features (Optional):

// Add a time limit for each guess.
// Implement user authentication to save and display personalized scores.
// Use emojis from a larger dataset or an external API.
// Implement difficulty levels that affect the number of options or time limit.
// Implement a ‚Äúhint‚Äù feature that provides a clue about the emoji‚Äôs name.

To start building your Emoji Guessing Game with Express, here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide:

1. Set Up the Project
Create a new directory for the project:

bash
Copy code
mkdir emoji-guessing-game
cd emoji-guessing-game
Initialize a new Node.js project:

bash
Copy code
npm init -y
Install Express:

bash
Copy code
npm install express
2. Set Up the Express Server
Create a file named server.js and set up a basic Express server:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Home route
app.get
