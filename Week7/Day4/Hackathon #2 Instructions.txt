Hackathon #2 Instructions

Dear students, you will start the Hackathon on tomorrow, Wed 18/09/24.
TOPIC OF THE HACKATHON
you can find it in the platform (Please pay attention that there are different ideas for Full-Stack and Data Analysis): https://octopus.developers.institute/courses/collection/111/course/260/section/1583
ABOUT THE HACKATHON
1. Duration: The hackathon starts tomorrow, Wed 18/09, until Sunday 22/09 at 9:00.
2. You should work in a group of maximum 2 people. You can also do the project alone if you want, but we STRONGLY recommend you to work in pairs.
3. You need to use the technical skills you've learn so far.
BEFORE THE START OF THE HACKATHON
1. Read the steps of the hackathon - https://octopus.developers.institute/courses/collection/111/course/260/section/1583/chapter/1154
2. MANDATORY - create a Github repository and use Github branches.
You need to create a new branch for each new feature.  Add 
@Raquel Boujnah
 as collaborator.
3. Write down the name of the group, the name of the participants and the details of your project on the Google Document here (scroll down to find the table for the #2nd Hackathon:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HN_X0xCwTOnrTzLaXC1ffpa5_WCUqWTUsQo0ET4zZ8E/edit?gid=0#gid=0
4. Your projects needs to be validated before you start working on it:
Until tomorrow morning:
Send a message by Slack to

You can only start working in the project after it is validated (tomorrow morning).
On Sunday until 9:00AM you need to have in the google sheet the following links:
GitHub repository
2min video showing your screen and explaining how your project works (you can use loom.com)
5. You will present your project to the class, on Sunday 22/09 from 15:00 to 16:30 to 
@Raquel Boujnah

Try use SOME of the following:
Node.js
JSON
Database
API (Requests)



Step of Innovation
DISCOVERY :Identify the strategic focus area, translate into themes of innovation & problem statement
IDEATION : idea collection & idea gratuation, bottoms-up ideation os trategic goals
PC CREATION : conceptualize idea, check for novelty, functionality, feasbility, alignment to strategic goals
EXECUTION : test the POC for feasability, market viability & scale

Welcome to your Hackathon !


Hackathon



Instructions
For the Hackathon this week, the aim is to practice the technologies you have learned in Python over the past weeks.
Try to use the following:

Python
JSON
Database
Files
Api (Requests)
Faker


Ideas of general topics for the hackathon
So for now, try and be creative. Here are a few ideas:

A game that runs in the terminal and saves to a database or file
A todo list that runs in the terminal and saves to a database or file
A connection to an API to get some interesting data and then 1. or 2.
For those who want to, you can explore building window style apps with a module called: Tkinter
All the best, work hard, have fun!



Ideas of Data Analysis topics for the hackathon .
Weather Data Analysis Tool: Build a Python application that fetches weather data from an API, stores it in a database, and allows users to analyze weather trends such as temperature changes or humidity levels over time.

Sales Data Analyzer: Develop a tool that reads sales data from a CSV file, performs analysis on key metrics like total and average sales, and stores the results in a database or generates reports in JSON format.

Health Tracker: Develop a health tracker that allows users to log their daily activities, such as steps and calories, analyze trends over time, and store the data in a database or JSON file.



Step of Innovation
DISCOVERY :Identify the strategic focus area, translate into themes of innovation & problem statement
IDEATION : idea collection & idea gratuation, bottoms-up ideation os trategic goals

Remember!
The competition is just a part of the hackathon. To make the most out of the event, try something new and teach other people!

Happy Hacking from the DI team!
