demo challenge from yesterday 
object and array is sent by reference

can use 3 dots to make a copy creating a new reference for 
the object so when it changes, it will render again
setLanguages(...languages)

in order to render the page, to change the reference, can do that by cloning using ...

should not touch the state, always make a copy of the state and then reference it.
only if using array and object which are both datatypes that are passed by reference

in redux will always make copy of the state

redux is state management in large scale applications

App.jsx is managing components, components should be new components in components folder.  
    return is a component

when wrapping componennt inside component you have access to children of component
    and becomes prop by default.

{count} -- is a jsx element

will wrap component

componentDidCatch = (error, errorInfo) => {
    this setState({ hasError: true});
};
