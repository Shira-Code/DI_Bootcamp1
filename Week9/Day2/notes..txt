useSelector will access the state
state.counter.count    ((()))

first value is the store, second value is the reducer, third value is state within the reducer

state = store
aaa, or = reducer
count = the state in the reducer


onClick ---- need to use dispatch to execute the action

async should not be in the reducer, it should be in action.
the action will already be in the store.

in order to dispatch directly from the store, can write type: INCREMENT

recommended to dispatch object directly from the store so it's less complicated

class exercise:
add 2 reducers:

inputaction.js
inputreducer.js

so that user input changes the h2


cannot use hooks in classes, so use "connect" from react-redux from store 
if exercise needs to use "connect' use hooks instead
can also use "connect from react-redux
